The reinforcement learning model learns to play the game of ZDoom - a popular First Person Shooter (FPS) game. This project was built using OpenAI's Gym environment wrapper for the game of ZDoom called ViZDoom. Implemented multiple models such as Deep Q-Network (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Actor Critic (A2C) using Stable Baselines. 

A demo of one of the game environment - Basic - is shown below:

And finally, a third demo of of the model at the same Deadly Corridor environment, but the agents are at a level 5 (max) difficulty:
